# crunch2.0
I love the crunch program in Kali Linux but it's really limited. 
Did you ever try to make a password that has capital and lover letters but it's a fixed word: `password, Password, pAssword` and so on.

Introducing the crunch2.0 that solves this problem. One little python script that does it all.
